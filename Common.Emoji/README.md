# SM.Common.Emoji

For now, this is just a placeholder for some emoji's / icons / wingdings

* GREEN_HEART = "💚"
* NECKTIE = "👔"

Ideally, this library will allow you to provide a piece of text and it will map to an emoji if it can.
This may have to mine some data and produce a JSON file (or something like that).
