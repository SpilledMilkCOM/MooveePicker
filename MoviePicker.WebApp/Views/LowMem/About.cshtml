			This website is used to mine box office movie data for use in the <a href="https://fantasymovieleague.com/" target="_blank">Fantasy Movie League</a>  game.
			The site will also use a bin-packing algorithm (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.solverfoundation.services(v=vs.93).aspx">Microsoft.SolverFoundation.Services</a>)
			to efficiently create your movie lineup based on the rules of the Fantasy Movie League.
			Since I have <strong>NO</strong> idea how to pick movies I figured I would rely on the "experts" and aggregate their data so I can make my own guess on the weekend box office predictions.
			I'll update this site and these comments when I can.  If the site is <strong>DOWN</strong>, I'll know soon enough (so you don't have to call me).  ;)
			I built this site for my friends and I at NCM when we found out about FML (YEAH, gotta love that abbreviation).  We didn't know that NCM was going to buy Fantasy Movie League.
			As developers we are <strong>LAZY</strong>, but we'll <strong>BUILD</strong> things in our spare time so we have MORE of it!

			This site's code lives on GitHub.  So &lt;meta/&gt;  You can look at the history of how all of the code came together.  It started out with a few tests and spreadsheets and <strong>GREW</strong> from there.

			<h3>Summary / Home Page</h3>

			I wish I had the time to make this site pretty like Pete's site, but I keep thinking up functionality and implementing it.
			I'll have to double check my numbers to make sure the "Mine" column didn't break things.
			The column titles are clickable with the column's source (they do not sort the columns).  I'm always up for new sources, so let me know if you feel like sharing.
			If you just want to go with the industry numbers then put a weight of 0 at the bottom of the Mine column.
			If you want only <strong>YOUR</strong> numbers, then put zeros at the bottom of all of the industry weight fields.
			Or you can mix and match and tweak the defaults and feed those numbers back into the calculations (kind of like a feedback loop).
		</div>

		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want to recalculate your numbers based on NEW weights you entered for the other BO predictions then set your number's weight to ZERO before you "Apply Weights".
		</div>

		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4>API / Request Parameters</h4>

			If you keep your numbers in a spreadsheet you can link directly to the index page and feed it your numbers.  There are 15 "bo" and 7 "wl" parameters separated by commas (standard request stuff).
			You can get a sense of this request if you click the "Apply Weights" button.  Maybe you keep your numbers in a spreadsheet, then you can use the LINK() and CONCATENATE() functions
			to build the URL for this site so it can help with your picks.  That's what Liem does.  He copies the aggregated data from the index page and then does his own thing with the data.
			NOW he can link back to this site for his picks.

			<h3>Thanks!</h3>

			Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdguru">Pete Johnson</a> who is (was?) the Fantasy Movie League "Nerd Guru".
			I <strong>LOVED</strong> his site, because once I have my dollar amounts I can PLAY with the numbers with his cool sliders...  What else do Math Majors do?
			As of (1/6/2017) his "Analyzer" site is down and he's been "bought out" by National Cinemedia.
			Not sure IF they paid him or how much.
			<p>
				Another thank you to the support of the Fantasy Movie League family

		<h4>Backlog (TODO list)</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Get the Tweet twitter text working so the FULL custom url can be shared without pasting.</li>
			<li>Separate the shared memory with the request memory (only mine data once to reduce requests on the source sites).</li>
			<li>Find more data to aggregate.  (Before the 10:00 am MST cutoff for picks.)</li>
			<li>Keep a history of data to figure out which "experts" are the best at what they do and then choose the weights accordingly</li>
			<li>Add a view for the simulation code which is already built.</li>
			<li>Add asynchronous feedback when mining the data.  It's fast enough that it's not really NEEDED.</li>
			<li>If you're looking for what's BEEN DONE then look at the GitHub history (link above).  You've probably noticed a few of these items have been REMOVED!  Yay progress!</li>
