<h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

<p>This website is used to mine box office movie data for use in the <a href="https://fantasymovieleague.com/" target="_blank">Fantasy Movie League</a>  game.
Since I have <strong>NO</strong> idea how to pick movies I figured I would rely on the "experts" and weigh their data so I can make my own guess on the weekend box office.</p>

<h3>Thanks!</h3>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdguru">Pete Johnson</a> who is the Fantasy Movie League "Nerd Guru".  I LOVE his site once I have my dollar amounts I can PLAY with the numbers...  What else do Math Majors do?</p>

<h4>Backlog</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Find more data to aggregate.  (Before the 10:00 am MST cutoff for picks.)</li>
	<li>Keep a history of data to figure out which "experts" are the best at what they do and then choose the weights accordingly</li>
	<li>Add a view for the simulation code which is already built.</li>
</ul>
